**Why This Matters**:
- **Direct hardware control**: Remove OS abstraction layer
- **Better performance**: Native execution without Python/OS overhead
- **Enhanced security**: Kernel-level isolation and protection
- **Full system control**: Process scheduling, memory management, device drivers
- **Keep AI power**: Python AI/ML layer on top of custom kernel

### 10.2 Current vs Future Architecture

```
User → Python App (Zenus) → Linux/macOS/Windows → Hardware
```
- Python-based application running on existing OS
- High-level system operations through OS APIs
- Excellent for rapid development and AI integration
- Limited control over hardware and system resources

**Target State (v2.0+)**:
```
User → Python AI Layer → Custom OS Kernel (Rust/C++) → Hardware
```
- Low-level OS kernel managing hardware directly
- Python layer for AI/ML intelligence on top
- Direct process, memory, and device management
- Custom file system and drivers

### 10.3 Hybrid Architecture Design

**Three-Layer System**:
