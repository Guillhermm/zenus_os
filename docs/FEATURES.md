# Zenus OS Features

Complete guide to all features and capabilities.

---

## 🧠 Intelligence Features

### Natural Language Understanding

Zenus understands intent, not just literal commands:

```bash
# These all work:
zenus "organize my downloads"
zenus "clean up the download folder"
zenus "sort downloads by type"
zenus "arrange files in downloads by extension"
```

**How it works**:
- LLM translates natural language to structured Intent IR
- Context-aware (knows your location, git status, time)
- Handles ambiguity and variations
- Asks clarifying questions when needed

### Automatic Complexity Detection

Zenus automatically detects when tasks need iterative execution:

```bash
# Simple task - one-shot execution
zenus "list files in downloads"

# Complex task - automatic iterative mode
zenus "read my research paper and improve chapter 3"
# Detected complex task (confidence: 92%)
# Using iterative execution...
```

**Detection criteria**:
- Multiple steps with dependencies
- Open-ended goals ("improve", "optimize")
- Verification needs ("ensure", "check")
- Large scope ("all", "entire")

### Context Awareness

Zenus knows your environment:

**Working Directory**:
```bash
$ cd ~/projects/my-app
$ zenus "show git status"
# Automatically operates on current git repo
```

**Time Awareness**:
```bash
$ zenus "what happened today?"
# Uses current date/time for context
```

**System State**:
- Git repository and branch
- Running processes
- Recent file modifications
- Project type detection

## ⚡ Performance Features

### Parallel Execution

Automatic concurrent execution for independent operations:

```bash
$ zenus "download reports: Q1.pdf, Q2.pdf, Q3.pdf, Q4.pdf from company.com"

Using parallel execution (estimated 4.0x speedup)
  Level 1 (parallel - 4 steps):
    [0] NetworkOps.download (Q1.pdf)
    [1] NetworkOps.download (Q2.pdf)
    [2] NetworkOps.download (Q3.pdf)
    [3] NetworkOps.download (Q4.pdf)

✓ Completed in 2.3s (was 9.1s sequentially)
4x speedup achieved!
```

**Features**:
- Dependency analysis (topological sort)
- Resource conflict detection
- Thread-safe execution
- Graceful error handling
- Estimated speedup calculation

**When parallelization happens**:
- Multiple independent file operations
- Batch downloads
- Independent system checks
- Concurrent package installations (when safe)

### Batch Optimization

Detects inefficient patterns and suggests better approaches:

```bash
$ zenus "copy report1.pdf report2.pdf report3.pdf ... (15 files)"

💡 Suggestions:
  ⚡ Use wildcard for batch operations
     Instead of processing 15 files individually, use: *.pdf
     Reason: Wildcards can reduce execution time by ~93%
```

**Optimizations detected**:
- Multiple similar file operations → wildcards
- Sequential downloads → parallel execution
- Repeated operations → caching
- Inefficient tool choices → alternatives

### Adaptive Retry

Automatically retries transient failures:

```bash
$ zenus "download https://api.example.com/report.pdf"
⚠️  Attempt 1 failed: Connection timeout
🔄 Retrying with backoff...
✓ Success on attempt 2
```

**Retry logic**:
- Network errors: Up to 3 retries with exponential backoff
- Timeout errors: Retry with increased timeout
- Permission errors: No retry (needs manual intervention)
- Unknown errors: One retry attempt

---

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### Undo/Rollback

Reverse operations when you make mistakes:

```bash
$ zenus "install packages: curl, wget, htop"
✓ Installed 3 packages

$ zenus rollback
Rolling back last 3 action(s)...
  Rolling back: PackageOps.install (curl)
  Rolling back: PackageOps.install (wget)
  Rolling back: PackageOps.install (htop)
✓ Successfully rolled back 3 action(s)
```

**Rollback capabilities**:
- File creation/copy/move → Delete/restore
- Package install → Uninstall
- Git commits → Reset
- Service start/stop → Inverse operation
- Container run → Stop and remove

**Rollback commands**:
```bash
zenus rollback           # Last action
zenus rollback 5         # Last 5 actions
zenus rollback --dry-run # Preview without executing
```

**Limitations**:
- File deletions (without checkpoint)
- Git push to remote
- External API calls
- Already-rolled-back actions

### Dry-Run Mode

Preview operations before execution:

```bash
$ zenus --dry-run "delete all tmp files in downloads"

Dry Run - Would execute:
  Goal: Delete temporary files

  Step 1: FileOps.scan
    Action: List directory contents
    Path: ~/Downloads
    Risk: 0 (Read-only)

  Step 2: FileOps.delete
    Action: Delete files matching *.tmp
    Count: 47 files
    Risk: 3 (Destructive)

No changes made (dry run)
```

### Risk Assessment

Warns about destructive operations:

```bash
$ zenus "delete all logs older than 30 days"

⚠️  High-risk operation detected
  This operation cannot be undone without backup
  Affects: 156 files

Destructive operations:
  • Delete 156 files from /var/log

Proceed? (y/n):
```

**Risk levels**:
- **0**: Read-only (list, read, show)
- **1**: Modify (write, move, create)
- **2**: Significant change (install, uninstall)
- **3**: Destructive (delete, irreversible changes)

### Sandboxing

Path validation and resource limits:

```bash
$ zenus "delete /etc/passwd"
❌ Safety violation: Cannot access /etc/passwd
   Reason: System file protection

$ zenus "read /root/secret.txt"
❌ Safety violation: Path outside allowed boundaries
   Reason: Access denied to /root
```

**Protections**:
- System file protection (`/etc`, `/sys`, `/proc`)
- Home directory restriction (by default)
- Command whitelist/blacklist
- Resource limits (memory, CPU)

## 💡 Learning Features

### Failure Learning

Learns from every mistake:

```bash
# First time - failure
$ zenus "docker ps"
❌ Permission denied: /var/run/docker.sock

💡 Suggestions to fix this:
  1. Add user to docker group: sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
  2. Log out and back in
  3. Verify: groups (should show 'docker')

📋 Recovery plan: [detailed steps]

# Later - intelligent warning
$ zenus "docker run nginx"

📚 Learning from past experience:
  ⚠️  Tool 'ContainerOps' has failed 1 time(s) recently
  Success probability: 50%

💡 Learned fix: Add user to docker group and restart session

Proceed anyway? (y/n):
```

**Learning capabilities**:
- Pattern recognition (8 error categories)
- Success probability calculation
- Recovery plan generation
- Tool-specific suggestions
- Retry decision logic

**Error categories**:
- `permission_denied`: File/directory access issues
- `file_not_found`: Missing files or paths
- `command_not_found`: Missing executables
- `syntax_error`: Invalid command syntax
- `network_error`: Connection problems
- `disk_space`: Storage issues
- `package_conflict`: Dependency conflicts
- `timeout`: Operations took too long

### Proactive Suggestions

Suggests improvements before execution:

```bash
$ zenus "copy file1.pdf file2.pdf file3.pdf ... (20 files)"

💡 Suggestions:
  ⚡ Use wildcard for batch operations
     Instead of 20 files, use: *.pdf
     Reason: 95% faster execution

  ⚡ Enable parallel execution
     Potentially 20x faster with concurrent copies
     Reason: Independent operations detected

  ⚠️  This might take a while
     20 file operations detected
     Reason: Large batch operation
```

**Suggestion types**:
- **Optimization** (⚡): Performance improvements
- **Alternative** (🔄): Better tool choices
- **Warning** (⚠️): Potential issues
- **Tip** (💡): Best practices

### Semantic Search

Find similar past commands:

```bash
$ zenus history --search "install python"

Similar commands found:
  [2024-01-15] "install python packages"
    Success: ✓
    
  [2024-01-10] "setup python environment"
    Success: ✓
    
  [2024-01-05] "install python3"
    Success: ✗ (Permission denied)
```

## 📊 Memory Features

### Session Memory

Remembers context within conversations:

```bash
zenus > read notes.txt
Content: "Meeting at 2pm. Call Bob about proposal."

zenus > append to it: "Sent proposal to Bob"
✓ Appended to notes.txt

zenus > show it
# Remembers "it" refers to notes.txt
Content: "Meeting at 2pm. Call Bob about proposal. Sent proposal to Bob."
```

### World Model
