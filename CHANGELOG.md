## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed
- **Result Caching Bug**: Fixed adaptive planner not clearing execution_history between commands, causing observations to show cached results from previous commands in the session
- **Anthropic Streaming**: Enabled streaming in regular execution mode (was only enabled in iterative mode), fixing timeout errors with Claude models on normal commands
- **Infinite Loops**: Added max 50 iteration limit, stuck detection (repeating same goal 3+ times), and user confirmation between batches to prevent runaway iterative tasks
- **Empty Observations**: Enhanced observation formatting to handle None/empty results gracefully, providing context even when commands produce minimal output
- **Large File Writes**: Added chunked writing (10MB chunks) for large files, enabling LaTeX documents and other big file operations
- **Package Operation Timeouts**: Removed fixed 300s timeout, using streaming executor with no timeout for install/remove/update operations
- **Shell Output Streaming**: Created StreamingExecutor for real-time line-by-line output with subprocess.Popen instead of subprocess.run

### Added
- **Real-Time Command Output**: All shell commands now stream output in real-time with dimmed formatting
- **System Resource Commands**: Added SystemOps.check_resource_usage() and SystemOps.find_large_files() for comprehensive system diagnostics
