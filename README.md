# Zenus

**An AI-mediated system layer that translates natural language into validated system operations.**

Zenus sits between you and the operating system. You describe what you want; Zenus figures out the right commands, checks them for safety, and executes them—tracking everything so mistakes can be undone.

```bash
$ zenus "organize my downloads by file type"
✓ Plan executed successfully

$ zenus "show me what's using the most CPU"
✓ Top 5 processes displayed

$ zenus rollback
✓ Successfully rolled back last action
```

---

## Long-term Vision

Zenus is designed with a clear long-term trajectory: **become an operating system**.

Today, Zenus runs on top of Linux as an intent-execution layer. Over time, the architecture is intended to evolve into a full OS where the interface, scheduling, and system management are all mediated through intent rather than traditional commands. Every design decision — from the Intent IR contract to the sandboxed execution model — is made with that future in mind.

The current release is **v0.3.0-alpha**, the foundation of that journey. It is a working system that runs on any Linux machine today.

    K --> O
    L --> O
    M --> O
    N --> O
    O --> P[Memory Layer\nSession · World Model · Intent History · Failures]
```

**Key components:**

- **Intent IR** — Every LLM output is validated against a typed schema before execution. No raw text is ever executed. This is the contract that makes Zenus safe and auditable, and the foundation for OS-grade determinism.
- **Failure Analyzer** — Warns before repeating known failures and suggests fixes based on past experience.
- **Dependency Analyzer** — Builds a dependency graph so independent operations can run concurrently.
- **Suggestion Engine** — Proactively recommends optimizations (e.g. wildcards instead of 15 individual files).
- **Action Tracker** — Records every operation as a transaction, enabling rollback.
- **Parallel Executor** — Runs independent steps concurrently via ThreadPoolExecutor.
- **Memory Layer** — Three layers with different lifetimes: session (RAM), world model (disk), intent history (permanent audit trail).

## Packages

Zenus is a monorepo. Each package has a defined role and maps to a component in the future OS architecture.

    CORE[zenus-core\nIntent engine & tools]
    TUI[zenus-tui\nTerminal dashboard]
    VOICE[zenus-voice\nVoice interface]
    VIZ[zenus-visualization\nChart & table rendering]

    CLI --> CORE
    TUI --> CORE
    VOICE --> CORE
    CORE --> VIZ
```

| Package | Description | Future OS Role |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| `zenus-core` | Intent translation, planning, tool execution, memory, safety | Kernel cognitive layer |
| `zenus-cli` | CLI entry point, argument routing, interactive REPL | System shell |
| `zenus-tui` | Terminal dashboard with execution log, history, memory view | Primary UI surface |
| `zenus-voice` | Speech-to-text and text-to-speech interface | Voice I/O subsystem |
| `zenus-visualization` | Automatic chart and table rendering for command output | Output rendering layer |

## Features

### Safety and correctness

- **Intent IR validation** — LLM output is parsed into a typed schema before any execution happens. Malformed or unsafe intents are rejected at the boundary.
- **Dry-run mode** — Preview the full execution plan without running anything: `zenus --dry-run "delete all tmp files"`
- **Sandboxed execution** — Path validation, resource limits, and permission checks on every tool call.
- **Risk assessment** — Destructive operations are flagged before execution.
- **Undo/rollback** — Every operation is tracked as a transaction. `zenus rollback` reverses the last action; `zenus rollback 5` reverses the last five.

### Execution

- **Parallel execution** — Independent operations are automatically detected and run concurrently (2–5x faster for batch work).
- **Adaptive retry** — Failed steps are retried with updated context from the failure observation.
- **Iterative mode** — For complex multi-step tasks, Zenus uses a ReAct loop: execute, observe, adapt.

### Intelligence

- **Failure learning** — Tracks failures in a local database and warns when a previously-failed operation is attempted again.
- **Contextual awareness** — Knows working directory, git status, system state, and recent history when constructing plans.
- **Optimization suggestions** — Detects inefficient patterns (e.g. processing 15 files individually) and suggests better approaches.
- **Tree of Thoughts** — For high-stakes decisions, explores multiple solution paths and selects the best one by evaluating confidence, risk, and speed.
- **Self-reflection** — Critiques its own plan before execution and revises if needed.
- **Goal inference** — Identifies implied steps the user didn't explicitly mention (e.g. adding a backup before a destructive migration).

### Memory

- **Session memory** — Maintains context within a conversation.
- **World model** — Learns persistent facts about your environment (frequent paths, preferred tools, project structure).
- **Intent history** — Complete audit trail of every operation.
- **Failure patterns** — Records what went wrong and what fixed it.

## Installation

### Snap (recommended for Linux desktop)

```bash
snap install --classic zenus
```

Or download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Guillhermm/zenus/releases) and install locally:

```bash
snap install --classic --dangerous zenus_0.6.0_amd64.snap
```

### pip

```bash
pip install zenus-cli   # installs zenus and zenus-tui
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Guillhermm/zenus.git
cd zenus
./install.sh       # creates venv, installs packages, configures LLM, sets up aliases
source ~/.bashrc
zenus help
```

The source installer guides you through choosing an LLM backend:

| Backend | Cost | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| **Ollama** (local) | Free | Requires 4–16 GB RAM. Full privacy. |
| **Anthropic Claude** | ~$0.003/cmd | Best reasoning. claude-sonnet-4-6 recommended. |
| **DeepSeek** | ~$0.0003/cmd | Strong performance at low cost. |
| **OpenAI** | ~$0.001/cmd | gpt-4o and gpt-4.1 supported. |

### Updating (source install)

```bash
cd zenus && git pull && ./update.sh
```

✓ Moved 47 files into 5 categories

zenus > show disk usage for my home directory

zenus > exit
```

### Direct execution

```bash
zenus "list files in ~/Documents"
zenus --dry-run "delete all tmp files"

### Rollback

```bash
zenus rollback          # Undo last action
